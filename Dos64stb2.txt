  Dos64stb2 is a variant of Dos64stb. In most aspects it behaves like
  Dos64stb, with the following differences:

   - it doesn't require the image to contain base relocations, because
     it is able to load the image at its prefered loading address.
   - it does not map the full physical memory in the page tables, but
     just the memory that the image "owns" ( + the conventional memory
     0-fffffh ). Also, it doesn't use 2 MB pages, but just the standard
     4 kB pages.
   - the image base address is not restricted to be < 100000000h.
   - the IDT is mapped at linear address 100000h, just above conventional
     memory.
