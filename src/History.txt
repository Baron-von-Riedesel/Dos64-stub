
    4.2.2020:
   - no restriction for value of RSP anymore when int 21h is called.
   - transfer flags bits 0-7 from real-mode DOS to 64-bit.

   30.1.2020:
   - carry flag of real-mode DOS call wasn't transfered to 64-bit.

   26.1.2020:
   - removed 32-bit segment, jump directly from 16-bit to 64-bit.
   - reprogram master pic only, IRQ0-7 mapped at INT 78-7Fh.
   - implemented DPMI function 0x300 (simulate real-mode interrupt);
     this function is used by the int 21h emulation.
